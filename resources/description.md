## Logistic

- 来自 *performative prediction* paper's reproduction.

- Used as a benchmark that uses supervised learning method (logistic regression)

- At the same time, inspires me of:

  - features: stra vs. non-stra
  - data processing: class balance & standardization

  

## GSC

- recommended at meeting 7.9
- double-Gaussian data generator
- 2D-data & visualization
